title: Where the Scribe Marks the Lemma
---

**Initial question:** how should we index this scholion marker?

Does this **γ'** "belong" to **ἀνὴρ** or **πεπίθοιθ'**?

**Initial possibilities:**

*  sloppy, *but* the lemma is **ἀνὴρ**
* the scribe follows convention; the lemma is **ἀνὴρ`**
* the scribe is sloppy, *but* the lemma is **πεπίθοιθ'**

[Scholion **γ'**](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:e3bifolio.v1:E3_128v_129r@0.1305,0.2361,0.1111,0.2938)

**Ηe begins from the matter itself,** for there was not need of introductions but quickness of counsel at such a time, but he begins in the optative, not the imperative.

---

...It is also good **to choose not one person,** for he would harm him, as while disregarding his safety, he would also shame the others, thus striking ambition among the best against one another. He did not criticize the meek, but he has permitted them silence without reproach.

---

...The **self-choosing** is also good, for he does not say `πεπίθοιθ᾽ ἐμοί` (can be convinced by me) but `εᾧ αὐτοῦ θυμῷ` (by his very own spirit) and `τολμήεντι` (daring) so that it all encapsulates the proposed deed.

**New possibility:**

* the scribe makes the marker ambiguous on purpose - one-word lemma not necessarily most precise

---


What choices does the scribe make when marking a lemma?

**Across folios:**  Upsilon 1.1, 127v-129v, Venetus B, 132v-134v

It is likely that because of the pains after a long day he [Diomedes] did not notice the one who speaks. Being made to stand up by the old man is pushy and annoying. And therefore he [Nestor] makes him [Diom.] stand *with his foot* while reproaching his carelessness.

Because [the formula] is transposed from here into the Odyssey on the bed of Peisistratus sleeping near Menelaus, for what reason thus with his foot and not with his hand : since indeed now he reasonably in this manner wakes one sleeping on the floor.
